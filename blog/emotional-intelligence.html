      The definition of emotional intelligence says the capacity to be aware of,
      control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal
      relationships judiciously and empathetically. It's the ability to
      recognise emotinal cues to how other people might be feeling, knowing your
      own strengths and limits and being empathetic.
