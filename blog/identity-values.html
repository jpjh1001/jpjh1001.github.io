      <p class="questions">
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </p>

      I witnessed two men exchanging blows in front of a bus stop. Everyone was
      just either filming or watching the fight so I decided to step in and
      break it up. I stepped in for their safety to make sure nobody got
      seriously injured. I was injured during the process but I still think that
      I made the right decision and would most likely jump in again to prevent
      other people from hurting themselves.

      <p class="questions">
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </p>

      The people around me have truly influnenced my values and identity.
      Through them, I learned to stay humble and be confident so that other
      people would respect me for who I am. Thankfully, I grew up with
      positive-minded people and was able to experience numerous cultures that
      helped me to filter out the good and bad that I then tried embed it into
      my identity.

      <p class="questions">
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </p>

      Getting along well with people is a strength that I think I have. I
      believe this will most definitely help me during my learning journey as I
      can ask for and give help to my peers when I experience trouble while
      learning how to become a web developer.

      <p class="questions">
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </p>

      I cannot say for sure about my career development but for my learning
      journey, I think I might have to juggle with one other personal
      commmittment that I made to myself. Besides that I think there shouldn't
      be much of a problem.

      <p class="questions">
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </p>
      Without getting into much detail, I would like to say that I was the
      middle man, eventually stepping up as the leader of the group so that
      there was still progress to be made and finishing our group project on
      time. I cannot come up with other strategies as I believe I tried numerous
      ones before but I am open to learn other ways to deescalate the tension.
