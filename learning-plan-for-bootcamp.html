        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? What are you hoping
        to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you
        like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in
        mind?
      </p>

      I wish to enter the field of IT and initially work as a front web
      developer. Then after gaining some knowledge, I'd eventually like to
      become a fullstack web developer! I wish I am equipped with the knowledge
      learned from Dev Academy into getting my first job in IT. As IT also
      offers remote work, I'd love to explore the world and not be bound in one
      place.

      <p class="questions">
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp? Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has
        your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered
        any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder
        you during Bootcamp?
      </p>

      <p>
        My biggest strengths would be that I am very approachable and have no
        fear in meeting/hanging out with new people. I think my biggest
        limitation would be keep up with the fast paced content that is expected
        to be taught during bootcamp. I hope I am well prepared for what is
        about to come.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p class="questions">
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be? While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is
        not what we would like you to consider in this plan. Non-technical
        challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in
        groups, speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine weeks,
        etc.
      </p>

      I think the biggest challenge would be to stay on top of the material, and
      achieve the 'average' standard of the class. I found foundations quite
      challenging but I hope this would change during bootcamp as I am forced to
      work hard from 8:30am to 5pm rather than myself allocating times when I
      wish to work/learn. Also, keeping focus for 9 weeks seems challenging but
      I think the peoeple around me would make the journey much better.

      <p class="questions">
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? At Dev Academy, we have a
        significant focus on human skills and improving yourself. Based on your
        strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would
        like to work on? For example, this could be communication, teamwork
        within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback,
        developing some leadership skills, or improving your self-awareness and
        reflective skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wish to improve on my explaining skills. Sometimes I find it a little
        challenging explaining a concept briefly so that others understand it
        the first time round.
      </p>

      <p class="questions">
        What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team? What does support
        look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp
        team's expectations, but it is helpful to voice these expectations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regularly checking on how I am doing, and whether I truly understand a
        concept by being asking me a concept that I've learned. I expect a lot
        support from them mostly from the tech perspective.
      </p>

      <p class="questions">
        What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp Based on your
        knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?
        Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
        programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage
        yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
        facilitators and industry/community representatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wish to stay fully focused on the bootcamp and nothing else as I
        believe I can create a bright and a promising career in the field of IT
        if I properly and successfully complete my bootcamp. When I get stuck, I
        would try ask my peers for help (if it does not bother their learning)
        as I think it is sometimes better to connect with the people at a local
        level. If I am still confused, then I would reach out to the tutors.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have to be honest, during foundations, I did not fully commit to the
        workload like I've promised myself before it began. Now as I know this
        can never work as it made me fall behind, I would need to fully commit
        to my studies, just searching and asking for help until I get a concept.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, I would not let go of my physical well being and try
        to go to the gym regularly as I would require a lot of stamina and
        endurance to be fully focused for 9 weeks.
