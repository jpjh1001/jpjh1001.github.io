        An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      To explain the relationship between Javascript, HTML, and CSS, I will be
      using the analogy of a mum/dad and their child. HTML is like the body of a
      naked child. Like a human body is comprised of bones and muscles, many
      components make up the HTML. A plain HTML can be read and function on its
      own just like how a child could walk and perform simple tasks using its
      limbs.

      <p>
        CSS is a styling component of HTML (child) and it could be seen as the
        clothing a child would wear. Based on the styling and the occasion, the
        child could dress up formally or casually to make the child look even
        more adorable. However, there are still some limitations to what a child
        can do, and when Javascript is linked to HTML and CSS, there would be
        more interactions between the user and the webpage. Javascript could be
        seen as the parent of a child, giving it instructions and guidance as to
        how certain things should work. Using these signals, the child (HTML and
        CSS) would act accordingly resulting in better responses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially, javascript controls the behaviour of different elements
        embedded in HTML (the child). It can react to the clicking of a mouse on
        the keyboard. It essentially gives behaviour to a web page.

      <p class="questions">Explain control flow and loops</p>

      control flow and loops Control flow is how a computer carries out its
      tasks. In a set of code, the norm is to execute the written code from top
      to bottom as if it were to follow a set of instructions from top to
      bottom. However, control flow can be altered based on how we manipulate
      the code (using loops or conditional statements) to make decisions about
      when we want certain things to happen. Loops Loops are a very convenient
      way of iterating something by using a few lines of code. It helps us to
      simplify drastically long lines and we are giving the program a set of
      instructions to carry out repetitive tasks. An example of everyday life
      with loops would be that of a car engine. As long as the key is inside the
      car key ignition then the engine would continue running until it is taken
      out.

        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
        it.
      </p>

      The DOM (document object mode) is a programming interface and it can be
      used with any programming language but is most commonly used with
      Javascript. It is a model which represents the HTML document as a tree
      structure. Simply put, the document in ('D'OM) can be seen as a file (in
      our case HTML or CSS files). The Objects (D'O'M) can be seen as the tags
      and the elements inside HTML and the model (DO'M') is the layout
      structure. By using DOM we can read, access, and update the contents of a
      document

      <p class="questions">
        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      </p>

      Objects are like variables but can assign many values. It consists of
      properties which includes keys and values. An object variable may be
      assigned many values to one variable and it could be seen as containers
      for named values called properties. const car {brand: 'toyota', colour:
      'red', model: 'supra'} The properties are written as 'key: value'. There
      are two ways to access a data from an object. If we wanted to display
      toyota on our screen, we could fetch this by either using car.brand; or
      car["brand"];

      <p>
        Arrays are also a special type of a variable as it can hold more than
        one value. Arrays can hold a lot of values under one variable name and
        these values can be accessed by referring to an index number. Each value
        in an array is assigned a number but it is important to note that array
        indexes start with 0. So 0 would be the first element and 1 would be the
        second element. For example, to access an element in an array of
        colours, const colours = [red, orange, yellow, blue) in order to access
        the orange element in the colours array, you would need to input let
        colour = colours[1];
      </p>

      <p class="questions">What are functions? Why are they useful?</p>

      I like to think of a function as a switch. Once a function is created and
      called, it performs the task it was designed to do. A function is made up
      of a function name and it takes on parameters. For a function to work,
      they need take in a value which in turn returns an output. A function is
      very useful because once a function is created, you can use it whenever
      you wish to using different arguments to replace the original paramters
      (placeholders).
