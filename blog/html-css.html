    <div>
    <h1 class="title">What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
    
    </div>
    
    <div>

    <p>I'd like to start off by mentioning that these are one of many jargons used in the IT field, and are some of the many ways that you could 'style' your webpage. However, to style a webpage you would need to link it to a file named HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is a language used to have a plain document uploaded on a webpage.  </p>

    <p>The terms margin, border and padding are used in the language of Cascading Style Sheets also known as CSS. It decorates the document created in HTML in order for the webpage to appear more aesethically for the viewers. </p>

    <p>These two languages go hand in hand and are basically all you need to build a webpage of your own! I'd like to think of HTML as a person and CSS as clothing (including accessories, hairstyles and makeup). Just like how a person would give out different impressions by the way they dress, a webpage would also seem completely different depending on how it is styled.</p>
    
    <p>Now that I have given you the most basic introduction what consists a webpage, I will now explain the roles of margin, border and padding and the differences between them.</p>
    
  </div>

  <div>

    During my explanations, I'd like you to think of an empty 2D box just like this one below.
    <p><img src="/styles/download.png" alt="an empty square" class="center"></p>

    <div>

      <p>The element <b>'margin'</b> is used when we want to control the space <em><b>outside</b></em> of the box.</p>
    <p>The element <b>'padding' </b>is used when we want to control the <em><b>inner</b></em>  space of the box.</p>
    <p>The element <b>'border'</b> is used when we want to control the  <em><b>border</b></em> (black lines of the empty box above) of the box.</p>
    </div>

  

      <div>
        <h2 class="header">Margin</h2>

       <p> Margin is used when you want to create space around the element, making space outside of the border.</p>
       <p>It is possible to individualy control all four sides surrounding a square from top, right, left and right.</p>

      </figure>

      </div>
      
      <div>
        
        <h2 class="header">Padding</h2>

        <p> Padding controls the amount of space within the box.</p>
        <p>And just like margin, it is possible to individualy control all four sides surrounding a square from top, right, left and right.</p>
        
        <figure>
         <img class="padding-image center" src="https://notesformsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Padding-Property.png" alt="padding-example">
         <figcaption>Fig.2 - padding showing top right left and bottom.</figcaption>
       </figure>

       <div>

        <h2 class="header">What is the difference between Margin and Padding?</h2>

       
        
        <figure>
         <img class="margin-padding-image center" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/q0OtjBrd3y63ZnP48U5XaLQuHd6vxx7-YhcRYQFDo-7pffomchARvs0BV--MJaVj-mBbjado7wrt4TossxN8U6_84i1xwGYWScgAblx_g4I10d14R1Qg69vqrNU955FVbY4OThYO" alt="margin-padding-example">
         <figcaption>Fig.3 - showing the difference between margin and padding</figcaption>
       </figure>

       <ul>
        <li>As shown in the image above, margin and padding perform similar yet different functions.</li>
        <li> Margins are used when you want change the position of your element on a webpage or to create space between other nearby elements.</li>
        <li>Padding is used to create space around the content of the element. It is generally used when you want to alter the size of an element.</li>
       </ul>
    
       </div>



       <div>
      
        <h2 class="header">What is a border?</h2>

        <figure>
          <img class="margin-padding-image center" src="https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/images/a/af/Cssed_borderstyles.png" alt="border-types">
          <figcaption>Fig.4 Different styles of borders</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>  A border is what is in between the margin and the padding. You can think of the border as being the frame of the empty box. It is possible to adjust the width, style, and the colour of a border. By adjusting these properties. The image above shows different types of borders which can be created.</p>

       </div>

       </div>

       <p>
        Here is the final relationships between margin, border and padding. These terms may of been a little bit confusing at first but I hope I gave you a better understanding of what they are and what they can perfom!
