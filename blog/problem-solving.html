      <p class="questions">
        Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you: 1. were blocked on a
        simple problem: what was the problem?
      </p>

      Understanding how to merge methods into functions and just understanding
      the whole concept was a struggle for me.

      <p class="questions">what problem-solving techniques did you use?</p>

      I tried using pseudocode as well as trying to explain the concept to
      myself.

      <p class="questions">how did you feel throughout the process?</p>

      I felt really pressured as I could clearly see others moving forward and I
      was still stuck on the same problem.

      <p class="questions">what did you learn?</p>

      I learnt that it's better for me to get more done while I'm in my zone
      rather than taking occasional breaks.

      <p class="questions">
        2. elegantly solved a problem. what was the problem?
      </p>

      I wouldn't say elegantly but I tried all methods to solving the gradebook
      and fizzbuzz question sets

      <p class="questions">what problem-solving techniques did you use?</p>

      Honestly I don't think I couldn't even bear the thought of using the
      techniques. I just wanted to solve the answer and get green ticks.

      <p class="questions">how did you feel throughout the process?</p>

      Very STRESSED!!!

      <p class="questions">what did you learn?</p>

      To try understand the content better and to manage my time more
      efficiently.

      <p class="questions">
        3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes: Pseudocode
      </p>
      This somewhat helped, breaking down the process into smaller steps.

      <p class="questions">Trying something</p>

      I feel confident just giving it a go but the confident soon disappers when
      I feel like I've tried most methods and they do not work.

      <p class="questions">Rubber ducky method</p>

      This one was barely used but I get the idea.

      <p class="questions">Reading error messages</p>
      I still have a little trouble reading the error messages besides the line
      in wihch the error is in. ----------

      <p class="questions">Console.logging</p>

      This one really helps as I can try out the code for myself and I get happy
      when it does its job.
      <p class="questions">Googling</p>

      Quite confident as most of my research was done through google.

      <p class="questions">Asking your peers for help</p>
      When at the same pace, I was confident but when I felt like they were
      ahead of me or that I was behind, I was a little self conscious in to
      asking them questions.

      <p class="questions">Asking coaches for help</p>

      I was really confident asking the tutors the questions as they were VERY
      helpful.
      <p class="questions">Improving your process with reflection</p>
      This sprint actually made me think about how I should approach my studies.
      It definitely made me reflect on things!!
