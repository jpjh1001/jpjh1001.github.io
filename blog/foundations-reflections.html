      <p class="questions">
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </p>
      I think this bootcamp made myself more humble. I say this because I use up
      to sprint 3, I was somewhat able to submit my work on time as I could
      understand what I was doing. Hoever, during sprint 4 and 5, I struggle so
      much that I had quite a few mental breakdowns. So these core reflections
      made me to reflect on how I was approaching the content.

      <p class="questions">
        2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
        and programming?
      </p>
      I think the role of my values were used as guidelines to which I followed.
      When things got tough (it was really tough for me during sprint 4 and 5)
      it was very important for me to ask myself the question, 'why did I start
      this in the first place?' This question was a good motivator to keep me
      going while learning the complex concepts.

      <p>
        The role of empathy was that when things got tough, I was able to
        receive more support than I was able to give to my peers which I think
        was really important to those people who weren't that accustomed to
        studying online.
      </p>

      <p>
        The role of self-awareness was to realise the current state I was in. To
        ask myself the questions, am I stuck? Or am I too hard on myself? These
        questions helped me to balance my stress levels during foundations. What
        helped me a lot when I was struggling was once again my tutors and my
        peers for encouraging me by giving me postiive messages and offering
        help when I was at need. Even when I was asking for help at a very late
        time of the day.
      </p>

      <p class="questions">
        3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </p>

      Initially, I thought it was a little bit weird having to reflect and
      complete the core learning activities. However, my thoughts on this change
      a bit as some of the exercises here truly gets me to reflect on what I
      learned in the tech section as well as giving me a break from coding and
      sort of forcing myself to reflect on my learning/well-being.

      <p class="questions">
        4. What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </p>

      <p>
        I can't recall the challenging aspects to core learning itself but to
        style the blogs using css was a little bit a struggle (but no way near
        the tech questions in sprint 4 and 5). I do have to go back and fix my
        css for the blog contents.
      </p>

      <p class="questions">
        5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </p>

      <p>
        I think it's because as mentioned by Dev Academy that employers are
        looking not only at an individuals coding ability but they also place a
        high emphasis on their interactions with people. The core learning makes
        you reflect on a concept and to answer the questions as if I was
        explaining to somebody. I think this is why we were made to practice
        pair programming as programming is not only about understanding the
        concept for yourself but to be able to write it so that it's
        understandable to others.
      </p>

      <p class="questions">
        6. Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
        of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        I do agree with that statement to some extent but i wish that time was
        allocated to teach main takeaways of that weeks sprint for the students.
        I think as some students don't approach the tutors for help as they get
        stuck, that I think it would be more effient to hold a end of week
        lecture sort of thing to just give an overall idea of that weeks key
        takeaways.
