      <p class="questions">
        <b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b>
      </p>

      I would like to start off my career as a web developer and then possibly
      explore the field of artificial intelligence and also app making.

      <p class="questions">
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </p>

      I would my strengths would be that when I first start learning something,
      I like to explore all the hidden corners of a topic. I set myself up
      properly to have a good start to the learning process. My weakness would
      be that occasionally when things get tough, I lack the perseverance to
      move forward. It could be because I lost interest or simply because I am
      trying to avoid hardships during the learning journey. This is something I
      must work on to achieve greater milestones in life.

      <p class="questions">
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </p>

      Being able to better explain concepts to people. To do so, I am prepared
      to work hard so that I can fully grasp the contents I'll be learning at
      Dev Academy.

      <p class="questions">
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </p>

      I would like to make sure that I divide the weekly tasks into smaller
      tasks so that it would be less likely for me to go through a mental
      breakdown by feeling bombarded by the amount of content we might have to
      learn for a particular week. Also, although the bootcamp at Dev Academy is
      a full-on course, I will make sure to take regular breaks and have a
      timeout when I need to.

      <p class="questions">
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </p>

      When I am stuck on the same topic for more than a few hours (maximum of a
      day), I'll seek help online to solve any queries that I might have. I will
      also seek help from my homegroup and my facilitators so that I do not have
      to go through a mental breakdown!

      <p class="questions">
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </p>

      I expect the team to be there when I am going through difficulties. Some
      of them are graduates from Dev Academy so I think it would be easier to
      connect to those who have already gone through the course. Also, I wish to
      receive good and honest feedback from the team in order for me to improve
      as a web developer.

      <p class="questions">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </p>

      I have a few days when I might not be able to attend the class in April
      (for personal reasons).
