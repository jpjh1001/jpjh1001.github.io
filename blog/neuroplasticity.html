        Research Neuroplasticity Discuss how understanding the principles of
        neuroplasticity benefits people.
      </p>

      The meaning of neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to adapt to new
      changes and discoveries by making neuro connections through growth and
      reorganisation. A few examples of how understanding neuroplasticity
      include improved cognitive function - through recognition of synaptic
      connections, the ability to learn something and recall the information may
      become easier through amplified connection with the neurons in the brain.
      2/enhanced emotional regulation - it could help people to adapt and change
      to certain situations which would help oneself to better manage their
      emotions, reducing the likelihood of being stressed out and

      <p class="questions">
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your benefit.
      </p>

      As every action we take and every thought we think changes our brain, to
      benefit from neuroplasticity, we could train our brain to focus on the
      positive side of things, to look for and to recognise good traits about
      ourselves or others. Treating our brain just like any other muscle, to
      train our brains to have a positive mindself would help us to achieve a
      healthy lifestyle.

      <p class="questions">
        What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
      </p>

      Carrying on with the topic of a positive mindset, we can meditate for two
      minutes, exercise often, recognising the things that make us happy, and be
      genuinely happy for others' achievements would increase both optimism and
      life satisfaction.

      <p class="questions">
        Research Growth Mindset Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
      </p>

      A growth mindset is recognising that your limits are endless. It is
      realising that our ability and intelligence could be improved through
      consistent effort, dedication, and learning. It is to recognise failures,
      challenges, and missed opportunities and use them as a motivator for
      growth and improvement rather than being frustrated and accepting the
      limitations of an individual's ability to grow.

      <p class="questions">
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
      </p>

      It reminded me of the importance of a growth mindset as I believe there is
      no finish line when it comes to broadening our knowledge. You can never be
      'done' studying.

      <p class="questions">
        How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?
      </p>
      Not to have a closed mindset, to stay resilient at all times, and to never
      give up.

      I think this topic was to remind ourselves that a positive mindset
      combined with continuous effort, would ultimately lead us to a healthier
      lifestyle and to become a better version of ourselves with enough effort
      put in.

      <p class="questions">What was it like to be fully listened to?</p>

      It was good to have somebody to talk to about my struggles with the
      content and what helped was that my partner was able to understand where I
      was coming from.

      <p class="questions">What was it like to listen fully?</p>

      Saying back what my partner said after they talked helped me better
      understand what my partner mentioned as I was saying it back. It helped me
      to better engage in the conversation which happened after the looping
      exercise.
